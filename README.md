# AirPurity: Sleek Indoor Air Quality Companion

Welcome to my repository for AirPurity, an innovative, open-source indoor air quality monitor I designed to enhance environmental awareness in personal spaces. This project harnesses the ESP32C3 microcontroller alongside the advanced Bosch BME680 sensor, providing real-time data on air quality, temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, all in a compact and user-friendly design.

My goal with AirPurity is to empower individuals like you and me to understand and improve the air quality in our living and working environments. By being aware of the air we breathe, we can take meaningful steps toward healthier lifestyles.

## Features
- **Accurate Air Quality Monitoring**: Measures various parameters including VOCs, CO2 levels, and particulate matter to keep you informed about your indoor air quality.
- **Temperature and Humidity Sensing**: Monitors the comfort levels of your environment.
- **E-Paper Display**: Offers crisp and energy-efficient readouts.
- **USB-C Powered**: Designed for convenience with a modern USB-C connection for power.
- **Rechargeable Battery**: Ensures portability and ease of use anywhere.
- **Future Expansions**: I'm excited about exploring the Bluetooth and WiFi capabilities of the ESP32C3 to enhance this project further.

## Open Source Commitment
I have made this project completely open-source, hosted right here on GitHub. I invite and welcome collaboration, modification, and distribution of AirPurity. The project is licensed under the MIT License, which guarantees your freedom to use and share it as you see fit, promoting a community-driven approach to better air quality.

I invite you to join me on this journey to make indoor air quality monitoring more accessible and insightful. Whether you're a fellow tech enthusiast, a health-conscious individual, or someone eager to contribute to a meaningful open-source project, your interest and involvement in AirPurity would be greatly appreciated.
